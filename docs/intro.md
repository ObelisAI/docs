# Welcome to Obelis AI

Obelis AI is your intelligent DevOps engineer that deploys applications to your own AWS account with zero DevOps knowledge required. Simply connect your GitHub repository, add your AWS credentials, and let AI handle the complex infrastructure setup, configuration, and deployment.

## What is Obelis AI?

Obelis AI is an AI-powered deployment platform that transforms the way developers ship applications to AWS. Instead of spending weeks learning AWS services, writing Terraform scripts, or configuring CI/CD pipelines, Obelis AI analyzes your code and automatically:

- **Detects your application type** (React, Node.js, Python, etc.)
- **Generates optimal AWS infrastructure** tailored to your needs
- **Configures security, networking, and scaling** following AWS best practices
- **Manages continuous deployment** from your GitHub repository
- **Monitors and maintains** your application health

## Key Benefits

### üöÄ Deploy in Minutes, Not Weeks
From GitHub repository to production on AWS in under 5 minutes. No DevOps expertise required.

### üí∞ Cost-Effective
Deploy to your own AWS account and pay AWS directly. No platform markup or hidden fees. Full cost transparency.

### üîí Enterprise-Grade Security
Your AWS credentials are encrypted and never leave your control. All infrastructure follows AWS security best practices.

### ü§ñ AI-Powered Intelligence
Our AI analyzes your codebase to automatically configure build settings, environment variables, and infrastructure requirements.

### üéØ Full AWS Control
Everything runs in your AWS account. You maintain complete control over your infrastructure, data, and costs.
